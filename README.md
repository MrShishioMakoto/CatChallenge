Cat Challenge:

This project was made as a code challenge. It's essentially an App that delivers a List of Cats (image and name). 
Allows the user to check details and favourite the most interesting elements. Aftwards he/she can check them on another tab that
presents the list of favourites (saved with CoreData during the process).

Code Implementation:

Normally I like to engage on an hipothetical organization on folders and files. 
The strategy was to implement the network layer and the decoding primarily. 
Once we got all the info I began to "paint" the UI part (started massive
and ended as modular as it can get). 
The logic was constantly in mind. The pagination and error handling were next and 
left for last the Unit Tests that made me do some changes after all.

Tools used:
Xcode, SwiftUI, Combine, CoreData, Proxyman, Git, SourceTree, MVVM
